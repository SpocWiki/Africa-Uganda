> The history of Uganda comprises the history of the people who inhabited the territory of present-day Uganda 
> before the establishment of the Republic of Uganda, and the history of that country once it was established. 
> 
> Evidence from the Paleolithic era shows humans have inhabited Uganda for at least 50,000 years. 
> The forests of Uganda were gradually cleared for agriculture 
> by people who probably spoke Central Sudanic languages. 
> 
> The Empire of Kitara grew out of the Urewe culture in the 10th century. 
> Following the migration and invasion of Luo peoples in about the 15th century, Kitara collapsed, 
> and from the ashes rose various Biito kingdoms such as Bunyoro alongside Buganda.
>
> In 1894, Uganda became a protectorate of the British Empire, 
> and in 1962, the United Kingdom granted independence to Uganda, 
> making Sir Edward Muteesa Walugembe the first President of Uganda and Kabaka of Buganda. 
> 
> Idi Amin deposed Milton Obote to became ruler of Uganda in 1971, 
> a position he would occupy for eight years until he was ousted in 1979 as a result of the Ugandaâ€“Tanzania War. 
> After a series of other leaders since Amin's fall, Yoweri Museveni came to power in 1986 and has led Uganda since then.
